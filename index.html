                                <p class="brazil">Brazil are the holders, having won the 2019 tournament when it was also played in front of their own fans. The 2021 Copa America kicks off in Brazil after being moved from Argentina with the home side favourites to lift the trophy. The players said their protest was not political and they pointedly sought to avoid the left-right polarisation that has beset the country in recent years and led to mass street protests. The players took the unusual step of publicly criticising the South American Football Confederation on Wednesday, barely a week after Brazil stepped in to host the tournament in place of Argentina, who pulled out after a surge in covid-19 cases. Brazil manager Tite named a strong 24-man squad on Wednesday after the Seleçao's World Cup 2022 qualifying wins over Ecuador and Paraguay.
